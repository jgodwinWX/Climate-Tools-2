# Climate-Tools-2

The first phase of this project is a script called temp_dwp.py that uses
archived METAR data from ISU to plot temperature and dewpoint observations
for a single site, as well as the 7-day running averages, and the 7-day
running averages of the daily max/min temperatures.

I would eventually like to expand this to plot other climatologies. Perhaps
I'll have it be able to use xmACIS data to plot histograms like in my original
climate-tools repository.
